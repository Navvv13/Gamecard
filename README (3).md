# Multiplayer Card Game

 A multiplayer card game that supports multiple players (up to 4) and different types of cards (e.g. number cards, action cards, etc.)


## Running the code
I used IntelliJ IDEA to run my code on my Pc. IntelliJ IDEA is an integrated development environment written in Java for developing computer software written in Java, Kotlin, Groovy, and other JVM-based languages.
## About the game

- This is a multi-player card game where each player starts with a hand of 5 cards.
- The game starts with a deck of 52 cards ( a standard deck of playing cards).
- Players take turns playing cards from their hand, following a set of rules that define what cards can be played when.

- A player can only play a card if it matches either the suit or the rank of the top card on the discard pile.
- If a player cannot play a card, they must draw a card from the draw pile. If the draw pile is empty, the game ends in a draw and no player is declared a winner..

- The game ends when one player runs out of cardswho is declared the winner.

- BONUS: 
    Aces, Kings, Queens and Jack are action cards. When one of    these is played the following actions occur:

    Ace(A): Skip the next player in turn

    Kings(K): Reverse the sequence of who plays next 

    Queens(Q): +2

    Jacks(J): +4

- NOTE: actions are not stackable i.e. if Q is played by player 1 then player two draws two cards and cannot play a Q from his hand on that turn even if available
